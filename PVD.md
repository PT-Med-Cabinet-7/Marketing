This is the template for the Product Vision Document that teams complete after their initial icebreaker. 
The PVD is crucial to the planning phase and **is mandatory for all groups to complete and submit to their Project Lead before 
starting their project.**

# ‚òùÔ∏è Proposal
- What problem does your app solve?<br>
       - make sure that users of marijuana are paired with strains that are compatible with them
       - helps with dose, intake methods, and schedule that they should use the medical for
       - people don't know what kind they need for their issue
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?<br>
       - It recommends to customers based on their preferences and medical requirements
       - Based on answers to a questionnaire or survey, it will recommend a certain type of treatment.
       - two main types; sativa, indica, hybrids; cbd concentrations (epilepsy, parkinson's, adhd)
       - each strain helps with something different (cancer, insomnia)
       - not recreation focused
- What is the mission statement?<br>
       - improvement of quality of life
       - giving you an edge by taking the edge off
       
# üí° Features
- What features are required for your minimum viable product?<br>

       - editable and deletable responses
       - highest strains per ailment or physical issue
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?<br>

       - can filter highest-rated strains etc.
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?<br>
       - leafly/weed maps:  have strain finders and local dispensaries or edibles, topicals, etc., ratings
       - yelp:  ratings, gps to a local dispensary address
